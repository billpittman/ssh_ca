# Git post-checkout hook to remove group writable bit from files in the 'certs' folder.
# This hook runs after:
# - git checkout <branch>
# - git clone (initial checkout)
# - git pull (implicitly, if it results in a new commit being checked out)
#
# Parameters passed to post-checkout:
# $1: old HEAD ref
# $2: new HEAD ref
# $3: flag (1 for branch checkout, 0 for file checkout)
# Note: These parameters are not strictly needed for this specific task,
#       as we are operating on the working directory regardless of checkout type.

# Define the target directory for certificates
CERTS_DIR="certs"

echo "Running post-checkout hook..."

# Check if the 'certs' directory exists in the working tree
if [ -d "$CERTS_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Found '$CERTS_DIR' directory. Adjusting file permissions..."

    # Find all regular files within the 'certs' directory and its subdirectories
    # and remove the group writable bit (g-w).
    # The '+x' at the end of find means it will pass multiple arguments to chmod,
    # which is more efficient than '-exec chmod {} \;' for many files.
    find "$CERTS_DIR" -type f -iname "*-cert.pub" -exec chmod g-w {} +

    echo "Removed group writable bit from all files in '$CERTS_DIR/'."

    echo "Directory '$CERTS_DIR' not found. No file permissions to adjust."
